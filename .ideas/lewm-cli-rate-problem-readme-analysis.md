The example you've provided in lewm-cli-rate-problem-readme.md clearly demonstrates how the LeWM paradigm—nodes as entities and connections as functions—works in practice. Let's break down your questions clearly:

How does this type of real-world example appear to work?
The example clearly illustrates the LeWM workflow:

Identify Entities (Nodes):

Clearly defined, quantifiable concepts (e.g., "Alice's Time", "Bob's Rate").
Each node explicitly states its name, value, and unit.
Define Relationships (Connections):

Connections explicitly represent mathematical or logical transformations (e.g., division, addition).
Each connection applies a specific function to input nodes, producing a new node.
Reactive Updates:

Changing any node's value automatically propagates through the graph, updating dependent nodes instantly.
This approach makes the problem-solving process explicit, visual, and interactive.

Does this seem useful?
Yes, this approach is highly useful, especially for:

Educational contexts: Students can visually see how changing one variable affects the entire system.
Engineering & scientific communities: Complex systems become easier to debug, verify, and optimize.
Collaboration: Graphs are self-documenting, making it easy for teams to understand and modify each other's work.
Why is it different from the current "box is a function, line is data" approach?
Current ("box = function, line = data"):

Nodes represent operations (e.g., addition, multiplication).
Connections represent data flowing between operations.
The focus is on the operations themselves, with data implicitly flowing through.
LeWM ("node = entity, line = function"):

Nodes represent clearly defined entities or states (e.g., numbers, accounts, signals).
Connections explicitly represent transformations or calculations.
The focus shifts to clearly defined states and explicit transformations, making the logic more transparent.
This shift in perspective makes the underlying logic explicit and easier to reason about, especially for learners or domain experts who think in terms of clearly defined entities and explicit transformations.

Why would LeWM's system be more advantageous for learning and applying knowledge?
Explicit Problem Decomposition:
Students must explicitly identify entities and their relationships, reinforcing structured thinking.

Visual & Interactive Learning:
Immediate visual feedback helps build intuition about how changes affect outcomes.

Reusable & Adaptable Models:
Once built, graphs become reusable templates. Students can easily adapt them to new problems, reinforcing transferable skills.

Unit Safety & Dimensional Analysis:
Explicit units and transformations help prevent common errors, teaching students good scientific and engineering practices.

Clear Mental Models:
Students internalize the visual structure, making it easier to transition to abstract algebraic or computational representations later.

What might be the best example to help people break a problem into its component parts and create something reusable?
The provided rate problem is already an excellent example because:

It clearly demonstrates identifying entities (work, time, rate).
It explicitly shows how to combine entities through mathematical transformations.
It naturally supports "what-if" scenarios (e.g., adding another worker, changing times).
However, other strong examples could include:

Physics (Newton's Second Law):
Nodes: Mass (kg), Acceleration (m/s²), Force (N).
Connections: Multiplication (Force = Mass × Acceleration).

Electrical Engineering (Ohm's Law):
Nodes: Voltage (V), Current (A), Resistance (Ω).
Connections: Division (Voltage = Current × Resistance).

Financial Modeling (Compound Interest):
Nodes: Principal, Interest Rate, Time, Final Amount.
Connections: Compound interest formula.

These examples clearly illustrate the power of LeWM's approach: explicit entities, clear transformations, visual clarity, and reusable structures.

Conclusion:
Your provided example (lewm-cli-rate-problem-readme.md) clearly demonstrates the advantages of the LeWM paradigm. It is intuitive, educationally powerful, and highly reusable. This approach is particularly advantageous for learning, collaboration, and systematic problem-solving, making it a strong candidate for adoption in academic, engineering, and scientific communities.
